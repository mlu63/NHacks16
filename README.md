# NHacks16
NHacks16 Event

NHacks16 was an interesting event, where I decided that I'd like to learn more about developing web applications. 
Our team decided to go with a simple marketplace web application, where users can rent out their video games to other
users in the area on a subscription basis (theme of the hackathon was "sharing"). 
Although we didn't come close to finishing our project, it was still a very fun experience that was quite eye-opening in terms
of web development.
